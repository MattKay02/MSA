        In a world with rising temperatures, increasing air pollution and impending collapse of ecosystems, new restrictions and rules are imposed. OVA looks to become a sanctuary for natural regeneration,
        education and freedom, providing a space where children can thrive within the future ecological boundaries of Las Vegas. OVA Kindergarten places a strong emphasis on community engagement, providing spaces that
        can be used by the public during non-school hours, creating a flexible and welcoming environment. This flexibility is continued throughout the project, adequately preparing for future challenges

        OVA reclaims stillness by grounding educational experiences in nature. Intentional rest, especially through dedicated moments of calm and quiet, is not treated as a break from learning but as a vital part of it. Surrounded by natural materials, soft light,
        and organic textures, children are given space for reflection and emotional reset. These restorative moments support mental clarity and balance, fostering a generation more mindful and deeply connected to their environment.
        Rooted in a deep respect for nature, OVA uses creative play as a grounding force to channel the imagination into sensory experiences. By holding a careful balance between exposure and protection, the
        project promotes unhindered curiosity. Patios act as transitional thresholds, offering shaded connections between interior learning spaces and the surrounding landscape.
